# COVID Analysis: A study in R
The goal of this project was to manipulate COVID-19 and population data across multiple soruces 
to solve desired inquiries. Local data from the United States as well as global data is analyzed.

The analysis was split into three separate Rmarkdown files.

## File Descriptions
The following files are found in this repository:
- **fips_population_estimates.csv**: county level population estimates
- **global_population_estimates.csv**: country level population estimates
- **README.md**: generates README in repository  
- **analysis_pt1.Rmd**: Rmarkdown file for part 1
- **analysis_pt1.pdf**: pdf generated by Rmarkdown file for part 1
- **analysis_pt2.Rmd**: Rmarkdown file for part 2
- **analysis_pt2.pdf**: pdf generated by Rmarkdown file for part 2
- **analysis_pt3.Rmd**: Rmarkdown file for part 3
- **analysis_pt3.pdf**: pdf generated by Rmarkdown file for part 3

Note that the images in the **Image** folder are ommitted from the above file descriptions,
as they are numerous and arbitrary without scope. These are used in the 
[Analysis and Results](#analysis-and-results) section.

Note that additional data is pulled from a github repository which hosts New York Times
COVID-19 data. This provides county level data of cumulative cases and deaths. This
is split into 3 years:
- [2020 Data](#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2020.csv)
- [2021 Data](#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2021.csv)
- [2022 Data](#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties-2022.csv)

## Functions
Most of the analysis follows singular pipeline code to either prepare tables or
plots. However, some of the data wrangling did present repeatable scenarios.

Functions:

**by_state(df, state):**
```
by_state <- function(df = df_with_pop_totals, state_name) {
  # filter by state
  df_state <- df %>%
  filter(state == state_name)
  
  # calculate new cases
  new_cases = c()
  for (i in 1:length(df_state$total_cases) - 1) {
    new_cases[i] = df_state$total_cases[i + 1] - df_state$total_cases[i]
  }
  new_cases = c(0, new_cases)
  
  # calculate new deaths
  new_deaths = c()
  for (i in 1:length(df_state$total_deaths) - 1) {
    new_deaths[i] = df_state$total_deaths[i + 1] - df_state$total_deaths[i]
  }
  new_deaths = c(0, new_deaths)
  
  # bind the new cases and deaths to the dataframe
  df_state <- df_state %>%
    cbind('new_cases' = new_cases, 'new_deaths' = new_deaths)
  
  
  # calculate the 7 day rolling averages for the new cases
  cases_roll_7 <- df_state %>%
    rollmean(x = new_cases, k = 7, align = 'right', fill = NA) %>%
    lag(n = 1)
  
  # calculate the 7 day rolling averages for the new deaths
  deaths_roll_7 <- df_state %>%
    rollmean(x = new_deaths, k = 7, align = 'right', fill = NA) %>%
    lag(n = 1)
  
  # bind the rolling cases and deaths to the dataframe
  df_state <- df_state %>%
    cbind('cases_roll_7' = cases_roll_7, 'deaths_roll_7' = deaths_roll_7)
  
  
  # add mutated versions of the 4 vectors created for the 100k by state result
  df_state <- df_state %>%
    mutate(new_cases_100 = (new_cases / state_pop) * 100000) %>%
    mutate(new_deaths_100 = (new_deaths / state_pop) * 100000) %>%
    mutate(cases_roll_100 = (cases_roll_7 / state_pop) * 100000) %>%
    mutate(deaths_roll_100 = (deaths_roll_7 / state_pop) * 100000)
  
  return(df_state)
}
```
    
**country_daily(df, country_name)**
```
country_daily <- function(df = df_global, country_name) {
  # filter by country and date
  df_country <- df %>%
    filter(country == country_name) %>%
    filter(date >= '2020-03-15') %>%
    filter(date <= '2021-12-31')
  
  # calculate new cases
  new_cases = c()
  for (i in 1:length(df_country$country_cases) - 1) {
    new_cases[i] = df_country$country_cases[i + 1] - df_country$country_cases[i]
  }
  new_cases = c(0, new_cases)
  
  # calculate new deaths
  new_deaths = c()
  for (i in 1:length(df_country$country_deaths) - 1) {
    new_deaths[i] = df_country$country_deaths[i + 1] - df_country$country_deaths[i]
  }
  new_deaths = c(0, new_deaths)
  
  # bind the new cases and deaths to the dataframe and choose required variables
  df_country <- df_country %>%
    cbind('new_cases' = new_cases, 'new_deaths' = new_deaths) %>%
    mutate(cases_100k = (new_cases / population) * 100000) %>%
    mutate(deaths_100k = (new_deaths / population) * 100000) %>%
    select(date, country, cases_100k, deaths_100k)
  
  return(df_country)
}
```
