# COVID Analysis: A study in R
The goal of this project was to combine multiple sources of data surrounding COVID-19 deaths and cases during
the pandemic. Accompanying this data is populations by US county and by country during this time period. The data was
cleaned, manipulated and analyzed to produce desired inquiries.

- **Data -> fips_population_estimates.csv**: county level population estimates
- **Data -> global_population_estimates.csv**: country level population estimates
- **Image** folder: image names are almost arbitrary
- **README.md**: generates README in repository  
- **analysis_pt1.Rmd**: Rmarkdown file for part 1

Note that additional data is pulled from a github repository which hosts New York Times
COVID-19 data. This provides county level data of cumulative cases and deaths.

## Functions
Most of the analysis follows singular pipeline code to either prepare tables or
plots. However, some of the data wrangling did present repeatable scenarios.

Functions:

**by_state(df, state):**
```
- df: input, dataframe as follows from the analysis
- state: input, state name
- output: new dataframe sorted by state and with the additional columns:
    - new cases
    - new deaths
    - rolling 7 day cases
    - rolling 7 day deaths
    - new cases per 100k of the state's population
    - new deaths per 100k of the state's population
    - rolling 7 day cases per 100k of the state's population
    - rolling 7 day deaths per 100k of the state's population
```
    
    
**country_daily(df, country_name)**
```
- df: input, dataframe as follows from the analysis
- state: input, country name
- output: new dataframe sorted by state and with the following columns:
    - date
    - country
    - new cases
    - new deaths
    - new cases per 100k of the country's population
    - new deaths per 100k of the country's population
```
