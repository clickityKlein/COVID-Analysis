## Data Description
The data used in this analysis was found on 

The author of the data used a BeautifulSoup webscraper to obtain articles and associated datapoints
from several different sources. The data was uploaded in three datasets:
- artices1.csv
- artices2.csv
- artices3.csv

The datasets contains about 50,000 articles each, and have (potentially) the following columns:
- ID
- title
- publication
- author
- date
- year
- month
- url
- content

The methodology section ahead will discuss cleaning and combining of the datasets, however,
the data used in the analysis was a combination of the three files reduced to a
total of 10,000 articles.
